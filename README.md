# Aliucord React Native

Aliucord Rewrite for the new Discord React Native alpha. Unfinished for now, 
you should probably not install this if you don't know what you're doing.

## Build

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Install

Kinda inconvenient for now, will be improved in the future

1) Install and enable the [Xposed Module](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordXposed/releases/download/1.0.0/aliuxposed.apk). Make sure you check Discord in application list
2) Connect your phone via adb and run `pnpm serve`
